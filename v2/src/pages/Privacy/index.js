          <p>
            We collect and process personal data about users in the EU only when

              Processing of user personal data is necessary for us to take, at
              the request of a user, steps before entering a contract or for the
              performance of a contract to which a user is a party. If a user
              does not provide the the personal data necessary to perform a

          <p>
            While we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that user data is
            secure and that users are protected, there always remains the risk
            of harm. The Internet as a whole can be insecure at times and
